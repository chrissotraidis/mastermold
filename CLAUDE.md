# 1. Overview

## Project Summary

> A personal **financial copilot web dashboard** — the user-facing surface of an > "Intelligent Financial Agent." It gives a single operator a personalized > pre-market briefing, a prioritized alert feed, a consolidated read-only portfolio > view, a decision journal with a published track record, a gamified paper-trading > sandbox, and an agent chat. It is **advisory only**: the app never has authority to > place a trade or move funds. This is a multi-asset (equities +...

## Core Workflow

This build runs task-by-task from `tasks.json` with lazy task details in `.scaffold/task-details/{position}.json`.

1. Run `bin/task status` or `bin/task next`.
2. Run `bin/task start {position}`.
3. Run `bin/task prepare {position}` (optionally with Codex preflight review enabled by the harness).
4. Run `bin/task dossier {position}` to print the consolidated per-task context (done_when, workflow gates, predecessor runbook in dependency-closure order, wiki entity excerpts + risk flags, implementation guidance, verification commands). This is the single source of truth for "what this task needs." Read it before anything else.
5. Implement the task so `done_when` is observably true through normal user flows.
6. Run `bin/task verify {position} --skip-runtime-deps` during iteration; the harness runs the full suite after the session exits.
7. Commit with `Task {position}: {title}`.
8. Run `bin/task done {position}`.

Use `bin/task error {position} "reason"` only when blocked after repeated fix attempts. Use `bin/task reset {position}` before retrying an errored task.

Other useful commands: `bin/task runbook-for {position}` (predecessor runbook only), `bin/task attempt-advisory {position}` (split suggestion when failed attempts exceed threshold), `bin/task split {position} "<contract-1>" "<contract-2>" ...` (decompose a task into behavior-contract children).

## Iterating on the spec

When `spec.md` changes after the initial build, use `bin/task sync`:

1. Commit the spec edit: `git add spec.md && git commit -m "spec: ..."`.
2. Run `bin/task sync` to produce `.scaffold/sync-proposal.md`. The classifier flags each spec hunk as new-task, modify-pending, inject-against-completed, deprecate, or refinement-noop. Medium/low-confidence entries are double-sampled with a critic pass.
3. Open the proposal in your editor. Per change block, flip `status:` to `accept`, `reject`, or `edit`. Accepted entries become tasks; rejected entries are logged and skipped.
4. Run `bin/task sync --apply` to mutate `tasks.json` and commit. Completed tasks are never modified — changes affecting completed work become new pending tasks via `inject-against-completed`.
5. Use `bin/task sync --show-drift` any time to audit completed tasks whose cheap probes no longer pass (e.g., a file that was deleted).

## Execution Rules

- `done_when` is the primary success criterion; file existence alone is not enough.
- Verify behavior through normal entry points and seeded flows, not only by direct URLs or isolated helpers.
- Required global checks live in `config.yml`. Task-specific checks live in `.scaffold/task-details/{position}.json`.
- Do not edit `runbook.md` manually; `launch-build.sh` owns runbook updates after successful verification.
- If a task touches one stack in a multi-stack project, still run full verification for all stacks.
- If a task adds auth, async work, seed dependencies, or user-visible actions, wire and verify them in real execution paths before marking done.
- Reuse existing definitions before adding new types, helpers, colors, assets, or manifests entries.

## Validation

- Run `bin/task verify {position}` for the authoritative task + global validation pass.
- Global check families: NPM install (required), TypeScript check, Route smoke test (required), Spec coverage audit, Test suite.
- Use `bin/spec_coverage` for coverage audits when checking overall build completeness.

- `.scaffold/task-details/{position}.json`: task-specific implementation guidance, verification, and optional preflight review
- `config.yml`: global verification, workflow capabilities, and runtime config
- `runbook.md`: what the app currently does after completed tasks
- `mockup-manifest.json` (if present): canonical screen inventory — screens with roles, routes, components, interactive elements, data entities, navigation, and realistic seed data. When implementing a frontend task, prefer this as the source of truth for screen structure and seed content over reinventing them from `spec.md`.
